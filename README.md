# Rovi Analytics Challenge: Tic Tac Toe
This is a basic coding excercise to demonstrate your beginner to intermediate
level front-end coding abilities.

*Please do not spend more than two hours on this project.*

## Instructions
Given the mark-up provided in `src/index.html`, make a working tic-tac-toe game
by writing javascript in `src/script.js`, and styles in `src/style.css`. Each of
the nine buttons provided in the markup should correspond to the nine squares of
a tic-tac-toe board.

*You should not modify the body of the `src/index.html` file.*

## Requirements
The complete game should adhere to the following:
1. Button clicks should alternate between placing `X`s and `O`s
2. Identify when there is a tie
3. Identify when there is a winner
4. Stylize or highlight the winning combination
5. Give user(s) the option to play again.

## Setup
To run your code, you may simply open `src/index.html` in a web browser.

## Dependencies
